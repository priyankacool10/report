\section{Future Scope}
The future scope of the project is that it can be used as any news giving application or it can be used to advertise your products,
telling the customers about new schemes and products coming to your shop.
This application of e-Notice can be further extended to include the following features:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{\emph{Categorization of Notice:}}\\
Notices can be categorized in different categories, so that its possible for user to easily manage the notices.
Categorisation can also be done by making groups. Defining the notice to be circulated in a particular group can make it more secure.

\item \textbf{\emph{Documents and PDF files:}}\\
The attachments can be further improved to include PDF files or Doc files. Then there will not be much need to send images with the notices.
A single file would serve all the purposes.

\item \textbf{\emph{Feedback:}}\\
Feedback on the notices can also be taken. It can increase communication among connected members and any issue can be easily sorted out on the spot.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}

I learned a lot by doing this project.
\begin{itemize}
\item Operating system:
Ubuntu
\item Languages used:
Java, Android UI, PHP for backend
\item Servers Used:
LAMP Server, GCM Server
\item Database:
MySQL, SQLite
\item Typesetting by:
\LaTeX
So during this project I learned all the above things. Before this project, I had no idea about
Java and Android for making application. Although I had little bit knowledge of
Ubuntu before. But now I learned a lot about Ubuntu and got knowledge of using Android and Java for developing mobile
application and PHP for server side scripting. Now I prefer to work on command line rather than graphically. I learned how to work
on shell script.\\
If I talk about the project, e-Notice Application has reduced lot of manual work. It has made notififying each and every user very easy and taht too with no time and place restrictions.
