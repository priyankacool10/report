e-Notice App helps you access online notices on your phone. It is an online notice board maker
where a group of people can easily communicate with each other by sticking virtual notes. These
notes can have text, images or include online videos such as from YouTube.\\ \\
The notice board has always been the place where staff/students gathers to get their latest release
of corporate news. eNotice brings the notice board to a virtual location where staff/students can
not only read notices, but immediately react and respond to them - from their own desks!
With this electronic notice and announcement system, notification may be sent out notifying
staff that a new notice has been posted, where staff may know if it concerns him directly.\\ \\
In this way, e-Notice Application also serves as a mailing list for all employees in the directory. This eliminates the
need to keep a separate mailing list which is hard to maintain due to the rapid movement of staff.
